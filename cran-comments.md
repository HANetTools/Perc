## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Version number was increased to "0.1.2".

* Tests for `valueConverter` was updated so that it is consistent with the most recent version of testthat.

* `as.conflictmat` was updated to fix minor issues in raw data with warnings returned to users about the fix, instead of returning erros as in previous versions.

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.2.3
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

There was 1 NOTE when checking package dependencies. 
No repository set, so cyclic dependency check skipped


## Reverse dependencies
This is no package depend on Perc.
