## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Fixed the misspelling of "Conductance" in DESCRIPTION (3:30).

* The original "simRankOrder" example was set as "Not Run:" on CRAN. A new example in which the number of SimAnnealings and simulations were greatly reduced for testing purpose only.

* More clearly identified the copyright holders in the DESCRIPTION.
  
* Package was re-tested in R 3.2.2

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.2.2
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 

There was 1 NOTE:

* This is a new submission.


## Reverse dependencies
This is a new package.
