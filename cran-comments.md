## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Version number was increased to "0.1.1".

* `as.conflictmat` was updated to export sorted matrix as the output.

* `simRankOrder` was updated so that the process of assigning IDs to rank orders does not depend on the order of the matrix.

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.2.2
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs, no NOTES. 


## Reverse dependencies
This is no package depend on Perc.
